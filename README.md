goagent-osx
===========

*Sep 26, 2014*

I want to do my bit for the *goagent* project which helps me a lot, though I'm new to cocoa development.

This app just contains basic functions at the moment, still I think, it will provides a convenient for those who are not experienced in terminal commands.

**goagent-osx.app should be located in the folder of `goagent/local`.**
